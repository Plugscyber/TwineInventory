# TwineInventory
Inventory code for twine with visual styling.
This is based on Gersande La Fl√®che's code for Twine Harlow found here. 
But edited to work with the current verison of Twine Harlow and with extra css and html styling to make everything format nicely visually.

Here is the link to that code:
