<!--Removing items is a little easier than adding them.-->

<!--Example 1:Removing a single item-->
<h1>Dropped it</h1>
(set: $inv to $inv - (a: "Sword")) 
If you have a sword you just dropped it!

<!--Example 2:Removing two items-->
<h1>Dropped it</h1>
(set: $inv to $inv - (a: "Sword", "Spellbook")) 
If you have a sword or spellbook you just dropped it!

<--Example 3: Removing an item depending on if the player has it in their inventory.
I find this better than the above as you don't have redudant information about dropping an item you don't have.-->

<h1>Dropped it</h1>
(if: $inv contains "Sword")[(goto:"dropped sword")]
(Else:)[You stumble but don't loose anything!]
  
<!--name this passage 'dropped sword"-->
  <h1>Oh no!</h1>
(set: $inv to $inv - (a: "Sword")) 
  You dropped your sword!
