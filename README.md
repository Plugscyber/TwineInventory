# TwineInventory
Inventory code for twine with visual styling.
This is based on Gersande La Fl√®che's code for Twine Harlowe found here. 
But edited to work with the current verison of Twine Harlowe and with extra css and html styling to make everything format nicely visually.

Here is the link to that code:

Please credit me and link to this github page if you use this code or modify it. Also link me to what you do with it. :D
